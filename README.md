### Completing a series of problems / tasks to build a real-world e-commerce web application

1. Step 1

   - Build header(navbar - logo points to home route and signup will point to signup route and cart will point to cart point route & other static content) & footer for your app

   - Set the routing system correctly for these routes, put demo content in pages to test routes for now

   - Build a single product component for now to apply it later to render a bulk of components from backend to pages later
